# ETGUI - Ethan's Text-based Graphical User Interface

ETGUI is a text-based graphical interface built in Python that allows for movement and interaction on a grid.

## Features
- Move objects on a grid using arrow key directions (l, r, u, d) or WASD.
- Customizable object types and grid layout.

## Note this is a very simple not too good basic gridlike gui/renderer with basic movements, this was made for fun, and will likly not be updated, you can make updates/changes, just give me credit

## Note this is a currently still very buggy and in its beta stage fill free to debug and tell me the fixes

## WILL CRASH PLEASE WAIT FOR THE NEXT UPDATE THAT FIXES ALL OF IT
